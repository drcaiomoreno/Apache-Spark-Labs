### Original Poem 

This is a poem originally written by John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) in the early 1800s. Full Poem: <BR><BR>

Dear Kate, <BR>
Here’s to the crazy ones.<BR>
The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.<BR>
The round pegs in the square holes.<BR>
The ones who see things differently.<BR><BR>

They’re not fond of rules.<BR>
And they have no respect for the status quo.<BR><BR>

You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them,<BR>
disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.<BR>
About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.<BR>
Because they change things.<BR>
They invent. They imagine.<BR>
They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire.<BR>
They push the human race forward.<BR>
Maybe they have to be crazy.<BR><BR>

How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?<BR>
Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written?<BR>
Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?<BR>
While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<BR><BR>

Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,
are the ones who do.<BR><BR>

Sincerely, John<BR>
